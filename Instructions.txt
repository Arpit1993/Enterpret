Hi there! My name is Arpit J Soni.


Steps: 

1.) Please do npm install so that the dependencies are installed.

2.) After dependencies are installed, please run the command "npm run dev". 

3.) After you run the "npm run dev" command, a new tab in your browser would be opened with the UI. 


I've used node v14.16.1. 

Note 1: I've added screenshots of the output in the 'Screenshots' folder.

2: I've recorded video of the output, due to large size (approx 245MB) cannot share the video over mail. I will share the GDrive link with Raveesh once the video is uploaded. 

3: You can reach me at 'miliyearpitse@gmail.com' for any further queries.

Thank You!
